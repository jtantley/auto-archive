## Project Summary

<!-- no header bar -->

|                                                           |                                   |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| ![Auto-Archive Icon](app/static/images/favicon-48x48.ico) | Current Version: **`v0.0.3-dev`** |

**Auto-Archive** is a historical preservation and archival tool that revolutionizes the fields of historical preservation, archival research, and general historiography. Auto-Archive provides an innovative method that combines cutting-edge technologies to permanantly change historical digital preservation through automation and artificial intelligence (AI).

Auto-Archive provides a user-friendly web app where users can upload and process documents effortlessly, using Python for the program's core backend code and a Flask framework for the frontend web app. Auto-Archive leverages AI and natural language processing (NLP) to automate the digital preservation and archival process by automatically generating comprehensive profiles for uploaded historical documents. These archive profiles include titles, summaries, categories, extracted entities, and more. Document profiles are saved in the Auto-Archive database. Users can use the frontend web app to browse uploaded documents.

_In future versions:_ Users will be able to use interact with an AI assistant named 'Clericus' using the frontend web app. Clericus will have full access to the Auto-Archive database and full permissions, so users will be able to use Clericus to search, analyze, update, compare, etc.

---

### Architecture

> **NOTE (08/25/23):** `v0.0.25-dev` is currently in progress.
>
> üì° **OpenAI API**: Auto-Archive uses OpenAI LLM for multiple functions, including document processing. As of `v0.0.25`, Auto-Archive uses the `gpt-3.5-turbo-16k` model.

---

#### Backend

The Auto-Archive backend is coded primarily in **üêç Python** `3.11.4`. It consists of multiple modules and files which are detailed later in this documentation.

---

#### Frontend

**Document processing:** When users upload documents, Auto-Archive creates a `document profile` for the document using the program's document processor. As part of the `document profile`, the document processor:

- generates document profile title
- generates document summary
- categorizes document
- extracts entities from document
- saves full document text

Auto-Archive's document processor leverages the üì° OpenAI API and the üìö **`spaCy`** library for the NLP and entity-related functions.

---

### Clericus (AI Assistant)

> **NOTE (08/27/23):** `Clericus` is in **`Active Development`** as part of `v0.0.25-dev` and so is not currently live and/or functional.
>
> However, here are some brief libraries/tools/features planned for `Clericus`:  
> &nbsp;

ü§ñ **Clericus** is the name of the AI assistant and chatbot that will be included in Auto-Archive `>v0.0.25`. Since it is still in development, only a few details/tools used by Clericus is listed here:

- **LangChain**
- **OpenAI API**
  - LLM model: `gpt-3.5-turbo-16k`
  - Chat completions
  - Function calling

It is planned that Clericus will have full read and write access to the document database so that users can use Clericus as a tool to query documents.

---

### Database Systems

Through `v0.0.2-dev`, Auto-Archive exclusively used **`Supabase`**, a PostgreSQL **RDBMS** (Relational Database Management System).

As part of the project's development roadmap, Auto-Archive will transition to using one or more `NoSQL` databases: for example, a vector database (**`Pinecone`**), graph database (**`MongoDB`**), or both.

---

#### Database Accounts

> _**As of 08-23-2023**_ **(`v0.0.25-dev`):**

Auto-Archive has accounts and credentials for each of the following database hosts:

**RDBMS:**

- üóÑÔ∏èüíæ PostgreSQL database:
  - [**Supabase**](https://supabase.com/dashboard/projects)

**NoSQL:**

- üóÑÔ∏èüìà Vector database:
  - [**Pinecone**](https://app.pinecone.io/)
- üóÑÔ∏èüï∏ Document/graph database:
  - [**MongoDB**](https://cloud.mongodb.com/)

> ---
>
> For all database credentials (API keys, user names, passwords, connection URLs, etc.), see the [**üåçÔ∏èÔ∏èüîê Env Variables**](#env-variables) section of this readme file.

---

### Frontend Web App

> üößüî± **Current Dev Version:** **`v0.0.25-dev`**

The Auto-Archive frontend is a üíª **web application**. Auto-Archive uses **`Flask`** as the frontend web app framework. Following the current dev roadmap, **`Vue.js`** will replace **`Flask`** as the frontend framework for `v0.0.3`. The framework is used to create and connect the frontend web app and UI with the Auto-Archive backend.

As of `v0.0.2`, the frontend has two primary functions:

- upload documents
- browse document profiles

> **NOTE:** The `Clericus` chatbot module (see below) is currently in development and will be the third primary function of the frontend web app.

_The following applies to pre-`v0.0.3` versions of Auto-Archive._

> _**NOTE:** The web app can be accessed at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)._

| Page Name         | Template                 | Navigation           | Description                                                                               |
| :---------------- | :----------------------- | :------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| base              | `base.html`              | _hidden_             | Flask "container" template used as the common structure for all other template pages      |
| Home              | `index.html`             | `/`                  | Users can navigate to the other main pages of the web interface from here.                |
| Upload Document   | `upload.html`            | `/upload`            | Users can upload a document to be auto-archived.                                          |
| Upload Successful | `upload_successful.html` | `/upload_successful` | Confirms to the user that the upload was a success.                                       |
| Archive           | `archive.html`           | `/archive`           | Users can browse all documents in the database. & interact with the Clericus AI Assistant |

Other important frontend files are the CSS spreadsheet (`app\static\css\style.css`) and static image and icon assets, including a banner-image, favicon, and logo/icon image.

#### Database Structure

‚è≥ **SECTION INCOMPLETE -- COMING SOON** ‚è≥
&nbsp;

> **NOTE:** Auto-Archive versions before `v0.0.3-dev` used **Supabase** (PostgreSQL database provider) as the only project database. Supabase was used as a traditional relational database.
>
> One of the major tasks of `v0.0.3-dev` is to **integrate new database hosts and structures**.
>
> The current dev roadmap requires `v0.0.3` to create a new database and switch to a provider of one of the two following types of databases:
>
> - **Vector database** [Pinecone]
> - **Graph database** [MongoDB]
>
> Switching to either of these database types should allow for more context and provide more detail and functionality to knowledge graphs. (Knowledge graphs are planned to be implemented in later dev versions.)
>
> Since we are changing database providers and types in the near feature, this section will not be more detailed until work on `v0.0.3-dev` begins.  
> &nbsp;

### `v0.0.2` Changelog

`üöÄ update complete`

    üöÄ `v0.0.2` completed August 23, 2023 üöÄ

- üóÉÔ∏è **Improve organization** of all documentation & directory files.
- ‚úíÔ∏è **Note ALL changes/updates** to any part of the program/project documentation.

#### Version System Update

> _The Auto-Archive development versioning system was updated on 08/16/2023 to better follow the Semantic Versioning standard._

The update to the versioning system is simple and should not result in any confusion this early in development. The only changes to the versioning system are:

1. Push the version number forward by one decimal ("0.2.0" becomes "0.0.2")
2. Remove decimal between `v` and the version number ("v0.0.2" instead of "v.0.0.2")

The following table shows the original Auto-Archive version syntax compared with the new syntax that follows the Semantic Versioning standard.

| Old       | New       |
| --------- | --------- |
| `v0.0.1`  | `v0.0.1`  |
| `v.0.1.5` | `v0.0.15` |
| `v.0.2.0` | `v0.0.2`  |

---

> **‚≠êÔ∏è NOTE:** Updating the new versioning syntax across the project is _in-progress_, but previous version styles may still be encounted in some files, documentation, etc. If the old syntax is encountered, the conversion is simple, and users can refer to the above table.

---

**"Subversion" System:**

Sometimes version numbers are extended during development when there are multiple 'versions' of the same file(s) in development that stem from the same primary version. The purpose of subversioning is to keep strict track of progress and changes during active development.

The "subversion" syntax may appear in different ways in project files and documentation.

The following table shows examples of how file subversion syntax may appear. Note that the subversion syntax is not as strict as the primary version number.

| Version  | Subversion        |
| -------- | ----------------- |
| `v0.0.2` | `v0.0.2.0823`     |
| `v0.0.2` | `v0.0.2.0823:1`   |
| `v0.0.2` | `v0.0.2.0823:2`   |
| `v0.0.2` | `v0.0.2:0823`     |
| `v0.0.2` | `v0.0.2[:0823]`   |
| `v0.0.2` | `v0.0.2-0823`     |
| `v0.0.2` | `v0.0.2.dev.0823` |
| `v0.0.2` | `v0.0.2-dev.0823` |

Subversion syntax is not strict since it is usually used much more temporarily than standard versioning. The primary purpose of adding a subversion number is to distinguish between different dev-versions of project files that stem from the same version.

The only rule for adding a subversion number is that the number should either be the month/year (MMYY) or date (MMDDYY). For example, both `v0.0.2.0823` and `v0.0.2.081923` would be acceptable. If the full date is given as part of the subversion, it is assumed that is the date when that stem of `v0.0.2` began.

### `v0.0.18` Changelog

`üöÄ update complete`

    üöÄ `v0.0.18` completed August 4, 2023 üöÄ

#### Entity Functions

Basic entity-related functions were added to `v0.0.18`. The new functions use the **`spaCy`** library to extract & classify entities from documents.

After extraction & classification, entities and their relationship with the document are stored in the database (see below).

#### Database Expansion

The database architecture was updated for `v0.0.18` to incorporate entity-data from new functions. Two new tables were added to the database: `entities` & `profile_entities`.

The `entities` table is a list of unique entities extracted from documents. Each entitiy has a unique `entity_id`. When saving entities to the database, the program checks the `entities` table to see if the `entity` already exists. If not, it adds the entity table. If the entity is already listed, the program notes the `entity_id` to use in the `profile_entities` table.

The `profile_entities` table is a junction table used for the one-to-many relationships between documents and extracted entities. The table has three columns: `profile_entity_id`, `profile_id`, & `entity_id`.

---

#### `v0.0.18` Frontend

`v0.0.18` features major updates to the "Archive" (`archive.html`) page. Archive profiles are now listed in a table structure with a "View Profile" button for each.

The "View Profile" button opens the "Profile" -- a modal window showing all of the documents' stored information, including extracted entities. See screenshots below.

### `v0.0.17` Changelog

`üöÄ update complete`

    üöÄ `v0.0.17` completed: August 2, 2023 üöÄ

**8/2/2023**:

- changed database credentials to environmental variables
- split database operations from `run.py` into new file: `core/db_operations.py`
- split logging operations/configurations into new file: `core/logging_config.py`
- added embedding functions for summarization & categorization NLP functions
- updated database to store embeddings
- fixed minor bugs

**8/1/2023:**

- added first version of NLP category classification function

- updated `archive.html` frontend

&nbsp;

---

#### Category Function

The `v0.0.17` update included a new`classify_document` function using embeddings. Here is a summarization of the `v0.0.17` function by ChatGPT-4 [Code Interpreter] (08/02/2023):

> &nbsp;  
> This code assumes that the `generate_embedding` function creates embeddings for a given text, and `calculate_similarity` computes the cosine similarity between two embeddings, which is a common measure for text embedding similarity.
>
> The logic of the `classify_document` function is as follows:
>
> 1. For each document category, it generates an embedding for the representative prompt text.
> 2. It calculates the cosine similarity between the document's embedding and each category's embedding.
> 3. It assigns the document to the category with the highest cosine similarity score, provided that the score is above a certain threshold. If no score is above the threshold, it assigns the document to the "Other" category.  
>    &nbsp;

#### `v0.0.17` Frontend

`üöÄ update complete`

Updates to the Archive page (`archive.html`):

- fixed page functionality
- document list restructured as a sortable table

I reformatted the "Upload Successful" page slightly (`upload_successful.html`) to make it more simple/functional/user-friendly. See the screenshot below.

### `v0.0.16` Changelog

`üöÄ update complete`

    üöÄ `v0.0.16` completed July 31, 2023 üöÄ

The following features/changes were part of the `v0.0.16` update:

1. **Confirmed OpenAI API** used correctly.
2. **Added a _"Successful Upload"_ page (`upload_successful.html`)**: Users are redirected to this page after successfully uploading a file. Page should have text saying upload was successful and large buttons for "Upload another document" and "Browse the archive".
3. **Updated "Archive" page (`archive.html`)**: Add an "Upload a Document" button (`upload.html`) to the right side of the "Back to Home" button.
4. **Updated "Upload" page (`upload.html`)**: add "Back to Home" and "Browse Database" buttons that mirror Archive page
5. **Increased the token limit**: Increase the amount of text that the program can process. If the file's text is still too long, notify the user that their file is too long instead of hitting an error. Token segmentation implemented for texts longer than the 4096 token limit.
6. **More accurate titles & summaries for long texts:** The program now generates relatively accurate titles and summaries for longer texts that require token segmentation.
7. **More specific title instructions:** Document titles will always be complete thoughts and not contain quotation marks.
8. **New `document_processor.py` module:** The `document_processor` functions have been removed from the main `run.py` file and are now located in a new `document_processor.py` module file. The `run.py` file pulls the `document_processor.py` code when it needs it. The new `document_processor.py` file is located in the `/core` folder.
9. **Image Assets:** Favicon, icon/logo, and banner image assets are now included in the program's frontend web interface, and the HTML files have been updated to incorporate them into the new layout.

### üìà Marketability

**08/18/2023:**

> To eventually market Auto-Archive, decision was made to **pivot Auto-Archive's purpose & functions completely for historical records**. Modern business documents are easier to OCR and extract data, but the market is saturated with competition, including from major companies like Microsoft and IBM. By optimizing Auto-Archive completely as a way to document and preserve historical records, we target a small niche, but it provides the greatest chance of profitability for the program.

**üöÄ PLANNED AUTO-ARCHIVE DIFFERENTIATORS:**

- ‚úçÔ∏è Automatic & accurate HTR/HWR
- ü§ñ AI Assistant and expert archivist, preservationist, historian, & analyst
- **üìú Advanced historical context analysis**
