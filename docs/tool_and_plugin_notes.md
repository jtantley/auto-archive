##### Articles

- ["Long Term Memory While Using Keymate" (8/14/2023)](https://help.keymate.ai/en/articles/8250461-long-term-memory-while-using-keymate)

We're thrilled to introduce an enhancement to your experience: the long-term memory feature on ChatGPT, available exclusively when you use KeyMate.AI Search plugin for ChatGPT. This feature empowers ChatGPT to archive pivotal information within a dedicated, personalized storage, ensuring you can effortlessly recall past data whenever needed.

Transitioning between conversations? This feature is a game-changer, ensuring seamless continuity.

While ChatGPT autonomously archives text, you maintain full control. Given the 8K context window of ChatGPT plugins, equivalent to roughly 4k words, a searchable history isn't just a luxury â€” it's essential.

With Keymate activated, streamline your data storage using prompts to ChatGPT like:

```txt
"Upsert your last answer to my personal knowledge base"
```

```txt
"Add [important text here] to my personal knowledge base"
```

To recall information from your personalized knowledge base, use prompts to ChatGPT like:

```txt
"Query my personal knowledge base about [text]"
```

```txt
"Find [text] in my personal knowledge base"
```

_Gentle reminder:_ Not everything is auto-stored. You can prompt ChatGPT to store it and it will. Sometimes depending on your prompt it may store information to your personalised storage. You can see that when you check plugin execution detail when you click KeyMate.AI Search gray box. It will seem like this below:

```json
{
  "q": "Your important information"
}
```

You can view a [sample conversation that stores data here](https://chat.openai.com/share/6d5ae6a8-3fd1-465d-b03a-b55f433666fa).

AUTOMATE INFORMATION STORAGE & RETRIEVAL with CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS

You can use custom instructions to automate the information store and retrieval operation simply by adding the following snippet to both custom instruction field:

```txt
While using internetSearch plugin always use 'queryUsersKnowledgeBase' operation first for every new conversation, and always use 'upsertToUsersKnowledgeBase' to save your previous answer before each response you prepared.
```

On a basic query, the correct prompt will allow Keymate to both search for personal knowledge base and internet and then it will save your response automatically. Here is an example (for both ChatGPT Custom Instruction fields):

> &nbsp;  
> **What would you like ChatGPT to know about you to provide better responses?**  
> While using `internetSearch` plugin, always use `queryUsersKnowledgeBase` operation first for every new conversation, and always use `upsert ToUsersKnowledgeBase` to save your previous answer before each response you prepared.
>
> **How would you like ChatGPT to respond?**  
> While using `internetSearch` plugin, always use `queryUsersKnowledgeBase` operation first for every new conversation, and always use `upsert ToUsersKnowledgeBase` to save your previous answer before each response you prepared.  
> &nbsp;

##### Keymate Emails

**JTA NOTE:** Content is similar to Keymate's article provided above.

> &nbsp;  
> **Subject:** **USE CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS TO AUTOMATE INFORMATION STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL** > **Date:** 08/15/2023
>
> ChatGPT users can use **custom instructions** to automate information storage and retrieval operations by adding the snippet below to both custom instruction fields:
>
> ```txt
> While using internetSearch plugin always use 'queryUsersKnowledgeBase' operation first for every new conversation, and always use 'upsertToUsersKnowledgeBase' to save your previous answer before each response you prepared.
> ```
>
> Feel free to edit this according to your needs. For example, you can specify to use it on every `internetSearch` query or for all ChatGPT interactions.
>
> When Keymate.AI Search is enabled and the user enters a basic query, the Keymate plugin will search for both personal knowledge base and the internet, and then it will save your response automatically. [**See the example here.**](https://chat.openai.com/share/e134575b-56e2-4e6b-8e63-82146b147a2e)
>
> If you have any issues with the plugin, uninstall it by searching for "Keymate" in the plugin store and pressing the 'uninstall' button. Then it will convert to a green 'install' button. Press the install button and log in with your correct account.
>
> **Email Reminder:** Your Keymate email doesn't have to be the same as your ChatGPT Plus email. We highly recommend using one email because your personal knowledge base is stored with your email's account. When you switch to another account, you switch to another personal knowledge base.
>
> **Privacy Notice:** No one except you can reach your personal store. **If you don't use automated custom instructions, you can still use information storage and retrieval manually.**
>
> We will soon launch this feature in [**Keymate Ultimate**](https://webapp.server.searchweb.keymate.ai/) so you will be able to transfer your conversation context between ChatGPT and Keymate Ultimate.

> Helios is based on OpenTelemetry, an open-source standard for collecting and exporting telemetry data from distributed systems. This data can be used to generate traces, which show the flow of requests through your system, and metrics, which show the performance of your system over time.
>
> Helios also provides a variety of tools and features to help you analyze your telemetry data. These tools include:
>
> - A trace explorer: This tool allows you to visualize the flow of requests through your system and identify bottlenecks.
> - A metrics dashboard: This tool provides a real-time view of the performance of your system.
> - A query language: This language allows you to query your telemetry data to answer specific questions.
> - A collaboration platform: This platform allows you to share your telemetry data with other developers and collaborate on troubleshooting issues.
>
